# Cookie Sales Analysis

## Data Cleaning and Integration Process

### Data Cleaning in Excel
1. Opened customer, orders, and cookie type CSV files in Excel.
2. Checked for misaligned columns, extra spaces, and unexpected characters.
3. Used Excelâ€™s Remove Duplicates feature to eliminate duplicate entries.
4. Identified empty cells and filled missing values with placeholders where appropriate.
5. Converted dates to a consistent format and standardized text to Propercase.
6. Deleted non-essential columns or rows.
7. Used Find and Replace to correct special characters and encoding issues.
8. Saved the cleaned datasets as new CSV files.

### Data Integration Using Power BI
1. Imported cleaned customer, orders, and cookie type files into Power BI Desktop.
2. Used Power Query Editor for additional data cleaning and transformation.
3. Defined relationships between tables by:
   - Linking customer table to orders table via CustomerID.
   - Linking orders table to cookie type table via CookieType.
4. Created visualizations like bar charts, column chart, table, and line charts to represent cookie sales data.
5. Arranged visuals on the canvas, and incorporated slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
6. **Publish and Share**: Publish the dashboard to the Power BI service and share with stakeholders.
